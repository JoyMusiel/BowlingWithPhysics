# COSC 416 - Studio (Game Development) 2
The Bowling with Physics project is a simple bowling game that makes use of physics, game management, and UI elements in Unity. Players are able to move their character left and right, aim their bowling ball with mouse navigation, throw the ball, and reset the bowling pins to keep playing. The game score is incremental and does not reset when the state of the bowling pins is reset.

The 3D model assets used for the bowling pins, bowling ball, and arrow were made in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/).
